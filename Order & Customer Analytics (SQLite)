##In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to quantify the statistics regarding customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
where Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct cs.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cs
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS fs
ON cs.order_id = fs.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price asc
LIMIT 1;


#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product;


#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(Quantity), Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;


#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct cs.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales fs
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cs
ON fs.orderid=cs.order_id
WHERE fs.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;


#9 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 
SELECT distinct location, Count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Location LIKE'%NY%'
and Length (orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
Having COUNT(orderdate)>2;


#10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT distinct Product, SUM(Quantity) as Total
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product;


#11 What was the average amount spent per account in February? 
SELECT SUM(fs.quantity*fs.price)/COUNT(cs.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales as fs
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cs
ON fs.orderID=cs.order_id
WHERE length (orderID)= 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#12 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
Order by Revenue desc
LIMIT 1;
